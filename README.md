##Manifold is a Internet of Things(IoT) platform based on the KRL Pico programing model. 
Manifold is under construction, to get started developing Manifold refer to https://picolab.github.io/manifold/docs/installation/index.html.
Note on local development- 
  After building with grunt I only had success serving the app locally with "grunt serve" command in the app directory.
