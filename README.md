##Manifold is a Internet of Things(IoT) platform based on the KRL Pico programing model. 
Manifold is under construction, to get started developing Manifold refer to https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Picolab/manifold/master/docs/installation/index.html.
Note on local development- 
  After building with grunt, the easiest way to serve the app locally is with the `grunt serve` command. If you prefer a general HTTP server, npm provides `http-server`. You may need to start your server in Manifold's root folder and manually append `/dist` to the URL in your browser.
